          Surrey On The Go is an application built for a non-profit agency, <a href="https://surreyservices.org/">Surrey Services for Seniors,</a> to coordinate the transportation services offered to its members. After gathering requirements from Surrey Services, we built an internal tool that mimics and streamlines the agencyâ€™s current processes. The application features unique user experiences for members, volunteer drivers, and admins. Upon request for a ride, the request is matched to drivers in the system based on drivers' availabilities, location preferences, and other considerations.
