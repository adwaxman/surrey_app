# Surrey On The Go

Surrey On The Go is an application built for a non-profit agency, Surrey Services for Seniors, to coordinate the transportation services offered to its members.  After gathering requirements from Surrey Services, we built an internal tool that mimics and streamlines the agencyâ€™s current processes. The application features unique user experiences for members, volunteer drivers, and admins.  Upon request for a ride, the request is matched to drivers in the system based on drivers' availabilities, location preferences, and other considerations.  Features on the admin panel - where most of the functionality resides - include coordination and documentation of outreach to schedule rides, viewing of archived and canceled rides, activation and reactivation of users, and adding of notes to drivers and rides.  

The application uses the Nominatim API to match drivers based on location preferences, Sendgrid to alert admins and drivers via email as necessary, and Google Maps to provide drivers with directions.
