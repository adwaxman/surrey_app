# Surrey On The Go

Surrey On The Go is an application built for a non-profit agency serving senior citizens to coordinate the transportation services offered to its members.  The application features unique user experiences for members, volunteer drivers, and admins.  Upon request for a ride, the request is matched to drivers in the system based on drivers' availabilities, location preferences, and other considerations.

The application uses the Nominatim API to match drivers based on location preferences, Sendgrid to alert admins and drivers via email as necessary, and Google Maps to provide drivers with directions.
